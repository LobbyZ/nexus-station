 <strong>1.Admins Are Here To Help</strong>
 <br/>
 <p>The Admins are avilible to help you! If you have a problem admin help it someone will respond to you, Want to do something a bit over the top i.e Barkeeper pissed you off and your an Atmo and want to drain the air ask first</p>
 <p>But take in mind were only human so it may take a lil while to get a response but dont worry that barkeeper wont be going far.</p>

  <br/><br/>
 
<strong> 2.ERP is allowed. </strong>
<br/>
<p>We allow people to fornicate on this station but during a time of which your not needed actively and its not done in public areas of the ship as SEC can and will bust you up for it, Heads can ERP (it is not looked upon warmly</p>
<p>but hey you gotta get some love at some point)but if someone needs you for your job and you actively ignore them or don't acknowledge them you will be JOBBANNED. WARNING! You can only erp if you have the other persons OOC</p> 
<p>consent even iff you planning to erm *ahem* rape *ahem* them IC ask OOCly first ok, result of erping with someone without there OOC consent will result in PERMABAN.</p>
 
 <br/><br/>

 <strong>3.No METAGAMING.</strong>
 <br/>
<p>We don't mind people playing on the same IP (two mates sat at there house playing together) some of us do that so we can't piss and moan at you for that but once you start telling each other that your being murdered to</p> 
<p>get your friend to help and have not said anything about it IC then we will.....fuck you up. we dislike IC in OOC it breaks rp and it's just kind of douchy so try to keep IC IC and not bring it into OOC al-right</p>
<p>....I SAID ALRIGHT!....good</p>
 
 <br/><br/>
 
<strong>4.No POWERGAMING.</strong>
<br/>
<p>If we find you powergaming we'll powerkick your ass off of our server we do not like people playing to win even if they are not an antag. Powergaming is looked down upon and personally, we find it pathetic.</p>
<p>If your walking round as sec in riot gear just because something may happen all shift and are rping why your char is wearing that badly we will have a very private chat with you and then tell you to stop being an arse.</p>

<br/><br/>

<strong>5.No GRIEFING.</strong>
<br/>
<p>Griefing is not cool guys beating the shit out of someone for no good reason ain’t what we do here or stealing high priority items once again...not cool. so you know what we say. DON'T FUCKING DO IT!</p> 
<p>If your not an antag and you don't have an objective to steal something or kill someone don't do it. If it makes a good bit of roleplay and is discussed OOC first with the other guy and he approves of being killed</p>
<p>then yeah that is good just make sure to tell us first and we'll tell you if its alright otherwise don't be a pussy dick alright...good. Oh also no shuttle griefing so if you haven't done your traitor objective by</p>
<p>the time you get to the shuttle you have failed. no waiting till the shuttle to kill your target.</p>

 <br/><br/>

<strong>6.Stay In Character.</strong>
<br/>
<p>Stay in character at all costs if you need help as you don't know how to do something involving game mechanics ask us via the Adminhelp button. If we believe your character would know how to do that we will tell you</p> 
<p>(like an engineer asking how to open up an apc) but if your character would not know how to proceed with that action (an engineer doing surgery) we will not help you we will politely tell you your character would not</p> 
<p>know how to do that, everything all good...good. Also if someone starts killing you for no good reason don't start screaming over OOC your being bludgeoned in the face keep it Ic (soo yell it over the in game comms if</p> 
<p>you can) if you bring it into OOC you will be addressed by an admin and dealt with how we see fit (probably a slap on the wrist the first time but if you persist or have multiple offences the severity of punishment will be increased)</p>
 
 <br/><br/>
 
<strong>7.Stick to what your character knows.</strong>
<br/>
<p>This means don't make a bartender who suddenly knows how to operate or don't make a chemist which know xeno archaeology. If you want to do these jobs you have two options. One make a new character in that job field.</p>
<p>Two make your character learn that job IC, That doesn't mean suddenly apply to that job and teach yourself it. It means pick a job your character knows then when your character gets a break go to someone in that field</p>
<p>and ask them IC to teach you a couple of things about that job. We say do this as it makes fantastic roleplay and so that if everyone knows your character as a botanist and your suddenly an engineer some people can be like
<p>"hold up guys i saw this guy learning he looks bit ropey but he can do it". We like this...we like it a lot...like your mum...hard and fast.</p>
 
 <br/><br/>
 
<strong>8.NO IC in OOC./ NO OOC in IC.</strong>
<br/>
<p>Right guys this right here...NO! Do not i repeat do not take IC matters into OOC every thing in game stays in game everything out of game stays out of game got it. Basically as said earlier don't start screaming someone</p>
<p>is killing you in OOC and don't tell anyone you are dead in OOC because it give it away to people that something is going on and then people will start to metagame or power game and it just gets stupid. So please guys keep</p>
<p>ingame information to ingame. Thanks guys this is something which annoys us to no end and just breaks the whole immersion of the game.</p>
 
 <br/><br/>
 
<strong>9.NO MULTIKEYING.</strong>
<br/>
<p>I don't even know why you guys would want to do this but yeah....we don't appreciate it so don't be a chuckle fuck and do it alright. Multikeying is where you have multiple byond account and users open on different computers</p>
<p>..or the same one and you play multiple characters at the same time, there is no reason to do this for legitimate reasons so this is a straight bannable offence as it can only be used for evil...EVIL I SAY!</p>
 
 <br/><br/>
 
<strong>10. Whitelisting.</strong>
<br/>
<p>Hey guys this is more like information then a rule but hey i'll write it here for all ya'll to see. First off the jobs you will need to be whitelisted to play are. 1.All head positions. 2.Security. 3.Ai and pAi</p>
<p>4.Borgs. To become whitelisted you have to show us that you can be competent, follow rules and be an excellent roleplayer. Sounds easy yeah. Well it is if you are not getting whitelisted and you feel like you should,</p>
<p>if you have played for a long time adminhelp it and we will happily say why you haven't, it could be due to how you play or it could be due to that we forgot as easy as that guys.</p>

<br/><br/>

<strong>11.Names.</strong>
<br/>
<p>Please make a normal name so that means a first and last name (David Albarn) Of course you can make fantasy esque names but not too far gone, if we believe your name is too ridiculous we will tell you politely.</p>
<p>Also please do not use honorifics such as Dj,Dr and such, that is not a name if you are a medical doctor you are automatically a Dr so no need to put it in your name. Finally guys please do try to stay clear of names from game</p>
<p>or movie characters well obviously recognisable ones such as Tiffa Lockhart or Jack Harkness if you know what i mean. Hope to see some good cool names but not ridiculous ones.</p>

<br/><br/>

<strong>12. You and your characters comfort.</strong>
<br/>
<p>This rule is basically saying don't walk round in a hardsuit all the time those things are heavy and cumbersome and are not comfortable at all, your character would not have a good time wearing them therefore they would only put</p>
<p>them on when needed so please try to stick in character and only where these when needed. Its not for us guys its for your character..think of your character.</p>
